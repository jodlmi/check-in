            We are aware that Foxtrail will take digital pictures on the trail
            unannounced and automatically to evaluate the number of people
            booked. This data is automatically and completely deleted after 24
            hours.

        <h1>Startinfo Foxtrail Aristoteles</h1>
        <p>You seem to have checked in well. Because it worked out so well, I'll tell you a secret:</p>
        <p><span class="strong">The Password for the online help is: Platon</span></p>
        <p>Right, that was also the mentor of Aristotles...</p>

        <p><span class="strong">So make a note of the password in the corresponding field on your trail documents</span>, so you can have it at your fingertips in a pinch.</p>
        <h2>Let's get going:</h2>
        <p>
          May I suggest you pick up my tracks outside the main station, on the square “Banhofplatz”.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are in the main hall, exit the station on the right-hand side, in direction of inbound trains.
          Perhaps you are familiar with Swiss indifference regarding idolatry, memorials or personality
          cult. Not so when talking about <span class="strong">lfred Escher</span>. He deserves a prime spot facing
          “Bahnhofstrasse”. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice the fellow below Escher. This guy is flirty and will look you straight in the eye if you catch
          the green line tram (one digit!) in the right direction.
          Read No 1 in your trail documents in the tram.
