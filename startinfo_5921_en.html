            Even the cleverest city fox needs occasional rest, peace and fresh
            mountain air. So I pack my rucksack and set off on my paws for the
            hiking paradise of Klewenalp in the canton of Niedwalden.<br />
            But what do I see in the corner of my right eye? Hunting lecherous
            bipeds?Jagdl√ºsterne Zweibeiner? But wait! - after all I am a wild
            animal and at home here in nature. <br />In order not to start the
            competition completely without a chance, I advise you to pick up the
            necessary hunting equipment at the cash desk of the Klewenalp cable
            car.<br />

            Have you laced up your hiking boots? Then you can start
            immediately!<br />The game starts right here, in the waiting hall.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="strong">Herzlich Willkommen</span>means welcome and is
            not an empty phrase - there is a lot of truth behind it.

            Those who don't get it right away don't have to despair immediately.
            Head up, open your eyes and fill in the solution for the clue BACCO
            in the trail documents.
          </p>
          <p>
            Too bad for you, you've dawdled too long and I'm already long gone!
            Take the next gondola to the top station and read CAMENTE in your
            trail documents immediately after boarding.
