            unannounced and automatically to evaluate the number of people
            booked. This data is automatically and completely deleted after 24
            hours.

          <p>You seem to have checked in well. Because it worked out so well, I'll let you in on a secret: Odysseus is called
              <span class="strong">Ulixes</span> in Latin. This is also the password for the online help.</p>
          <p><span class="strong">Write down the password in the corresponding field on your trail documents</span>, so you can have it at your fingertips in a pinch.</p>
          <p>You've got your heart set on following my lead. Bugger! That's a good start! I've lost the clues for your first post... I'm sorry for that. Maybe you could check the SBB lost and found office to the left of the entrance. Good luck, you'll need it!</p>
